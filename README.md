# Fake-News-Detection-using-ML-Algorithms

To start with the project, begin with dowloading the dataset from the following link:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JRBnMWyicTuP5avT60-el5iimzkBy3aO?usp=sharing

After successfully downloading the datasets run the python code to see how machine learning approaches like:
--> Logistic Regression
--> Random Forest Classification
--> Decision Tree Classification
can be successfully implemented to detect whether the news is fake or real depending upon the dataset used.
